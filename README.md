# gps-direction-distance-tracker
Python application to calculate real-time distance and direction between the device and a GPS module.
The program was developed in Python and deployed on a Raspad tablet for portable field tracking.

This system was developed as part of a High-Altitude Balloon project (Passenger IV).
The goal was to track the payload during ascent, burst, and descent phases to assist with recovery operations.
